# RecipeFinder

To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

The recipe finder is a web application that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients. The application uses the Spoonacular API to retrieve recipe data.

You can search for recipes by entering ingredients in the search bar. The application will display a list of recipes that match the ingredients entered. You can click on a recipe to view more details about it, including the recipe's title, ingredients, and instructions.
